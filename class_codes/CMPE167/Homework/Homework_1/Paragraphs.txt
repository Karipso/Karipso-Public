CMPE 167-Homework 1

7:
The front part of my hand was more senstive than the back of my hand
as expected. Additionally, the tips of my fingers on both ends were more
sensitive than the other areas. As I moved down to my wrist from my
fingertips, it became less sensitive and as a result I needed the
toothpicks to be more apart to distinguish them. The reason for these
difference is due to evolution. We, as humans, are evolved to use the
tips of our fingers. Therefore, the tips of our fingers have more nerve
endings and these endings are closer to the surface of the skin. This
gives our fingertips a greater ability to sense while touching. As we
go to our wrist from our fingertips, the number of nerve endings
decrease and they get deeper into the skin.

With both eyes open, we can't you find our blind spot because each eye
has a different blind spot in 3D space. This means that the blind spot
of one eye doesn't correspond to the blind spot of the other eye. This
means that when one eye has a blind spot at a certain position the other
one doesn't and can clearly see what the other eye can't see. Therefore,
our brain can combine these two images and we get no blind spots.
When the mouse disappears, the bars of the cage don't disappear at the
blind spot like the mouse does. This is due to the fact that our eye can
see bars to the left and right of the blind spot. Using this information
our brain does some interpolation and fills in the blind spot with cages
although the eye doesn't see anything. All of this is possible because
our eye can see bars to the left and right of the blind spot but it
cannot see mouses to the left and right of the blind spot.

This same phenomenon can happen in sensors. Similarly sensor can do
interpolation and there can be more than one sensor of the same kind or
different kind with different or same orientations to compensate such
blind spots.
