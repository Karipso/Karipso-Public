-Summary of the lab-
This lab was really long and complicated; therefore, we had to have partners. I think
the most important part of this lab was working efficiently with your partner. Also,
it was the most difficult one. Additionally, understanding concepts behind field.h and
protocol.h was crucial because creating your agent.c impossible without knowing what you
are doing. Lab manual did a relatively good job of explaning things but I think it was
still insufficient. For example, things like how uart worked and how we needed to do 
manipulations inside our agent.c were not explained at all so people who didn't understand
the concepts deep enough would have no way of figuring out it on their own. It was the
hardest thing that I did for a class ever.

-My approach to the Lab-
I started by reading the lab manual but I didn't have anything about the field. So, for 
a couple of hours it was difficult to understand what I needed to do. Also, the lack of
FieldOledDrawScreen confused me as I thought I had to write this function on my own.
After reading the .h file and thinking for a while, I was able to start coding. I followed
the iterative design guidlines. As a result, I tested each function extensively before starting
the new one. Therefore, I had no errors and I didn't have to debug field.c while writing
artificialagent.c. We lost the most time debugging protocol.c as my partner made some errors.
Additionally, limiting our malloc usage was crucial because at some points we ran out of
heap. I would approach this lab exactly the same as not many people can finish this lab.
I think that I and my lab partner did a pretty could job. Of course, we could do better but
the learning curve was really high and we had to do other things for our other classes.
Working with a partner was ok but difficult as sometimes you could feel stressful and tense.
I am generally not a fan of partnered works as most of the time I am the one who needs to
do the most job and help the other person(s).

-Implementing the lab-
We were able to finish the lab totally but with using all of my late hours which is 66 hours.
We wouldn't be able to finish it on time otherwise as my partner's protocol didn't work for 
a long time. I probably spent close to 70 hours on this lab. I liked it but I think it deserves
more time and not reasonable as the 2nd last project. This should have been our final lab.
However, grading was fair overall. The lab manual didn't talk about field.h at all and it
didn't explain a lot of crucial point; however, it at least didn't have misleading parts this time.
It was overall an insufficient lab manual. Class material didn't cover enough for this lab. Therefore,
they didn't help that much.
