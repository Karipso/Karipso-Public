--Submitted Files--
List.java, ListClient.java, Lex.java, Makefile and README.

List.java: This is the file in which we create the List class. It includes the methods necessary
that are necessary to work with a List which is essentially a doubly-linked list. In this project,
we use List class to hold the sorted sequence of indexes for String array[] that has words. The
list is used it sort the String array[] indirectly. Then, it is used to print the words in the
correct order to a file.

ListClient.java: This source code was provided by Prof. Tantalo on the class website to test our
List.java methods. It tests most of them.

Lex.java: This is our main file where we use List.java. Here, we first get two command line
arguments which correspond to args[0] = input file and args[1] = output file. We read the
number of words in the input file and then create and array of enough size to hold those
words. Afterward, I created an integer array[] to hold the indexes that were going to be sorted.
I used insertion sort to sort the indexes. Before doing so, I create a List object named myList
which is initially empty. After the insertion sort, the indexes are sorted and hold by the
integer array[]. Since we were expected to insert the indexes to our list in a sorted order,
I append()ed the elements of the integer array[] from the beginning to the end to the empty
list. Now, myList holds the sorted sequence of indexes. Afterward, I open/create the output file
indicated by args[1] and write the words into it using myList as the index. This way the words are
printed in an alphabetically sorted way as the ones that come first are on the top and the ones
that come later are on the bottom. Lastly, I delete all the used elements to free the memory space.

Makefile: This is the file that is used to conveniently compile the required files and delete them
if need be.

README: The documentation for this assignment.

Note: I didn't alter the Makefile provided neither ListClient.java. I didn't put my name etc. at
the top of ListClient.java because in the pdf it clearly says do not alter.
