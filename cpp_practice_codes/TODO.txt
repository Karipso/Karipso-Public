1) What is the implementation for the code below regarding the
   conversion from "int pointer" to "InputIterator" and how is
   the comparison done inside the range constructor? (How do
   we know myints + 5 is the end)
int my_ints[]= {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
std::set<int> second (my_ints, my_ints + 5);

2) Does <vector> contain <utility> ? In one of my codes, this seemed
   to be the case as the compile didn't complain about not including
   <utility> when I put <vector>. If you can't find the answer, ask it
   on stackoverflow.

3) How can we more quickly find the right "other side"? Well, we 
   actually know the other side of (x, ?). It's x + k or x - k.
   If we sorted the array, we could find the other side for each
   of the N elements in 0 (logN) time by doing a binary search.
   
   We now have a two-step algorithm, where both steps take O(N log N)
   time. Now, sorting is the new bottleneck. Optimizing the second 
   step won't help because the first step is slowing us down anyway.

   Cracking the Coding Interview, page 67 (k difference problem).
   
   How is both the sorting part and the binary search part O(NlogN)?

4) Study std::stringstream!
