1) Indent your code blocks with 4 spaces.

Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.

If I am using Visual Studio Code and choose "Indent Using Spaces" and use the tab key, does this
violate this recommendation or not?

2) 
list.append(x)

    Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].

What is a[len(a):] here? And more speficially, what is len(a):?
